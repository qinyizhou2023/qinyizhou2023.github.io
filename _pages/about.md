Hi!
I am Zhou Qinyi (周沁怡), a third-year master's student in Industrial Design at Tsinghua University Academy of Arts & Design. I am supervised by [Prof. Sai Ma](https://www.ad.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1226/15203.htm) and [Prof. Yingqing Xu](https://www.ad.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1265/15135.htm). I am currently a research intern in [MSRA](https://www.msra.cn/) from Oct 2023. Previously, I was a visiting scholar in [HCI lab](https://hci.ucla.edu/) at UCLA from Sep 2023 to Aug 2024. I collaborated with [Prof. Xiang "Anthony" Chen](https://hci.prof/) about overreliance on AI.

My research interests is in the intersection of AI and design. I design, develop, and evaluate AI tools to support creative thinking and ideation. I believe in the transformative potential of AI to empower human creativity and facilitate new forms of creativity support tools.

My research focuses on:
- How users' cognitive and behavioral patterns affect their interaction with AI tools
- How to design AI tools to support a human-AI co-creation process
