üñêHi!
I am Qinyi Zhou (Âë®Ê≤ÅÊÄ°), a third-year master's student in Industrial Design at Tsinghua University Academy of Arts & Design. I am supervised by [Prof. Sai Ma](https://www.ad.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1226/15203.htm) and [Prof. Yingqing Xu](https://www.ad.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1265/15135.htm). I am currently a research intern in [MSRA](https://www.msra.cn/) from Oct 2023. Previously, I was a visiting scholar in [HCI lab](https://hci.ucla.edu/) at UCLA from Sep 2023 to Aug 2024. I collaborated with [Prof. Xiang Anthony Chen](https://hci.prof/) about overreliance on AI.

My research interests is in the intersection of AI and design. I design, develop, and study interactive AI systems that augment human capabilities in creative and critical thinking. Recently, I investigate how AI can not only scaffold but also inspire human creativity through human-AI co-creation.

My research focuses on:
- How users' cognitive and behavioral patterns affect their interaction with AI.
- How can we design systems/theory to better support human creativity via human-AI co-creation.

üì´ Get in Touch: 
I'm always interested in collaborating with researchers who are good at AI, phycology. Please feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:qinyizhou@tsinghua.edu.cn).
