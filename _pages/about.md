I am Zhou Qinyi (周沁怡), a third-year master's student in Industrial Design at Tsinghua University Academy of Arts & Design, supervised by [Prof. Sai Ma](https://www.ad.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1226/15203.htm) and [Prof. Yingqing XU](https://www.ad.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1226/15204.htm). I am currently a research intern in [MSRA](https://www.msra.cn/). Previously, I was a visiting scholar in Anthony's lab at UCLA, where I collaborated on responsible AI.

My research interests span creative AI, user-centered design, and the integration of human creativity with machine learning models. I believe in the transformative potential of AI to empower designers and facilitate new forms of creativity.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
