üñêHi!
I am Qinyi Zhou (Âë®Ê≤ÅÊÄ°), a first-year PhD student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST),, supervised by [Prof. Yike Guo](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=yike-guo-yikeguo) and [Prof. Huamin Qu](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=huamin-qu-huamin).
Before joining HKUST, I obtained my B.S. degree from the Academy of Arts & Design, Tsinghua University, where I was supervised by  [Prof. Sai Ma](https://www.ad.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1226/15203.htm) and [Prof. Yingqing Xu](https://www.ad.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1265/15135.htm). I worked as a research intern at [MSRA](https://www.msra.cn/) from Oct 2023 to Apr 2025. Additionally, I served as a visiting scholar in [HCI lab](https://hci.ucla.edu/) at UCLA, where I collaborated with [Prof. Xiang Anthony Chen](https://hci.prof/) about overreliance on AI.

My research interests is in the intersection of AI and design. I design, develop, and study interactive AI systems that augment human capabilities in creative and critical thinking. Recently, I investigate how AI can not only scaffold but also inspire human creativity through human-AI co-creation.

My research focuses on:
- How GenAI influences human creative workflows and cognitive processes.
- How to design AI systems that support creative thinking while mitigating cognitive biases and overreliance.

üì´ Get in Touch: 
I'm always interested in collaborating with researchers who are good at AI, Psychology. Please feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:qinyi.zhou@connect.ust.hk).
