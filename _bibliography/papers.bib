        Product metaphors, which involve creating products that convey meaning through metaphorical associations, are a powerful tool in product design. However, according to our formative study, novice designers often struggle to establish coherent links between target and source, to manage the complexity of diverse mapping possibilities, and to balance product usability with metaphorical expression. To address these challenges, we introduce ProductMeta, a creativity support tool designed to support novice designers in exploring and developing metaphorical product designs. ProductMeta incorporates domain knowledge and decomposes the design process into iterative modules and framework-based interfaces, fostering both divergent and convergent thinking. Through user studies, we demonstrate that ProductMeta enables novice designers to generate diverse and contextually relevant design ideas by facilitating structured exploration. We conclude with design implications for human-AI co-creation.

    Nowadays, novice users often turn to digital tutorials for guidance in software. However, searching and utilizing the tutorial remains a challenge due to the request for proper problem articulation, extensive searches and mind-intensive follow-through. We introduce "Docent", a system designed to bridge this knowledge-seeking gap. Powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), Docent takes vague user input and recent digital operation contexts to reason, seek, and present the most relevant tutorials in-situ. We assume that Docent smooths the user experience and facilitates learning of the software.
