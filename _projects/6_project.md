## Research Background

The integration of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) in product design represents a significant shift in the design industry. This research explores how AIGC can enhance and transform the wearable product design process.


## Research Methods
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/projects/aigc/1.png" title="AIGC Wearable Design Overview" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>


## Design Exploration

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/projects/aigc/2.png" title="AIGC Wearable Design Overview" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>


## Design Scheme

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/projects/aigc/3.png" title="AIGC Wearable Design Overview" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

**Key Findings**
1. More specific and creative contents are needed in the design process.
2. Designers should utilize AI's content selectively.

<!-- ## Future Implications
- New workflows for product designers
- Enhanced personalization capabilities
- Evolving role of designers in AI era -->
