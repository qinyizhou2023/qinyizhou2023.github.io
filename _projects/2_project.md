> "Cuby and His Shadow Friend" is an embodied, game-based STEAM learning book designed to help children aged 6-9 explore concepts of light and shadow through interactive, parent-child co-reading. By using embodied learning principles, the book engages multiple senses, enhancing cognitive and emotional development through tactile, auditory, and visual interactions.

### Design Process

#### Participatory Design Approach

To ensure our educational resource effectively meets children's needs, we employed a participatory design methodology. Our design process:

##### Research Participants
- 3 children (ages 6-9)
- 3 parents
- 2 science education teachers
- Interdisciplinary expert team

##### Methodology
Semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather insights about:
- Children's reading habits and preferences
- Parents' observations of learning processes
- Teachers' experiences with educational materials

### Design Goals
- Integration of game-like interactive elements
- Balance between educational depth and accessibility
- Clear, structured activity guidelines
- Reduced text density with enhanced visual communication
- Incorporation of hands-on experimental components


### Interactive Design Details

The book features six interactive scenarios that teach different aspects of light and shadow physics. Each interaction is designed to transform abstract physics concepts into tangible, playful experiences that align with children's natural curiosity and learning patterns.

### Key Innovations

**1. Multiple Embodied Interactive Designs**
- **Interactive Contextual Learning**: Children actively control flashlight positions to observe shadows, transforming abstract concepts into tangible experiences.
- **Multimodal Interactive Design**: Integration of tactile and auditory elements enhances the learning experience.
- **Multi-Material Handicrafts**: DIY activities strengthen emotional connections while promoting understanding of light and shadow principles.

    </div>
</div>

**2. Narrative Design: Learning Guided by Plots**
- **Emotional Engagement**: Minimalist character design focuses attention on light and shadow phenomena.
- **Progressive Knowledge Integration**: Story complexity aligns with learning objectives.
- **Hidden Narrative Layers**: UV light reveals concealed dialogues, encouraging exploration of more difficult concepts.

**3. Low-Cost and Long-Term Utilization**
- Practical design optimizes space through strategic structural layout
- Embedded structures enable varied interactions within limited page surfaces
- Reusable elements extend the book's lifecycle


### Educational Impact

</div>

User studies have shown that the book's multi-sensory, interactive features are highly engaging, particularly for younger readers. The UV light feature and prism cut-out activities have proven especially effective in sparking curiosity and facilitating understanding of complex scientific concepts.

### Future Development

Future enhancements may include:
- Integration of augmented reality (AR) for independent exploration
- Optimization of production costs and components
- Expansion of the Cuby character into a broader educational IP
