# Cuby and His Shadow Friend - A Game-Based STEAM Learning Book for Kids Ages 6-9

### Introduction

"Cuby and His Shadow Friend" is an embodied, game-based STEAM learning book designed to help children aged 6-9 explore concepts of light and shadow through interactive, parent-child co-reading. By using embodied learning principles, the book engages multiple senses, enhancing cognitive and emotional development through tactile, auditory, and visual interactions.


### Design Process

#### Participatory Design Approach

To ensure our educational resource effectively meets children's needs, we employed a participatory design methodology, actively engaging end-users in the development process. Our approach involved:

</div>

1. **Hide and Seek**: A pop-up cloud structure with integrated sound effects teaches shadow formation. Children use a flashlight to observe how clouds block light, creating a direct connection between daily experiences and scientific principles.

2. **Dancing Shadows**: Through rhythmic music integration, children move a flashlight to create dancing shadows, learning about the relationship between light source movement and shadow positioning.

</div>

3. **Shadow Theater**: A pop-up theater structure with insertable geometric shapes demonstrates how light travels in straight lines. Children create various shadow patterns by manipulating shapes and observing their projections.

4. **Sun Bathing**: Using a guided track system, children move a light source to simulate the sun's daily path, learning how Earth's rotation affects shadow length throughout the day.

5. **Cuby'sColorful Friends**: Through an innovative track mechanism, children guide Cuby through six colored light beams, discovering how different colors combine to create white light.

6. **Color Refraction**: The book's climax features a hidden prism within Cuby, allowing children to explore light refraction and spectrum formation through hands-on experimentation.
