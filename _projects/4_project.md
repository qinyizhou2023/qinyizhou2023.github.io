> Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects approximately 6-9% of pregnancies in the US. Proper sugar control during pregnancy is crucial for both mother and baby's health. However, current sugar monitoring methods can be cumbersome and stressful for pregnant women.

**Design Challenge**

How might we help pregnant women with gestational diabetes better monitor and control their blood sugar levels while reducing their stress and anxiety?



## Design Research

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/projects/sugar/research.png" title="Research Findings" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/projects/sugar/research1.png" title="Research Findings" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/projects/sugar/research2.png" title="Research Findings" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

### Key Findings:
1. Pregnant women need frequent blood sugar testing (4-7 times daily)
2. Diet control is challenging due to pregnancy cravings
3. Emotional support is crucial during this period
4. Current monitoring methods can be inconvenient and cause anxiety
